 and also others who are human have said:

"Dr. Edwards, a PhD holder from CU Boulder and Stanford, focuses on distributive asynchronous system cloud architecture and machine learning, with their PMLL code (found here currently: https://github.com/Qchains/cpm-cli) on 
@GitHub
 exploring short-term versus long-term memory in AI using a "mimemograph" mechanism.

Their work challenges conventional AI memory models by integrating neuroscience principles, potentially impacting fields like distributed systems and real-time applications such as VoIP or multiplayer gaming, as noted in related web results on distributed architectures."
"Dr. Edwards' work aligns with recent neuroscience-AI collaborations, such as those in ScienceDirect, where deep learning models brain functions like memory and visual processing, offering new insights into computational psychiatry and AI-driven neuroscience research"


## Kris Kowal, an Abstract

Kris Kowal is a highly influential figure in the JavaScript community, primarily recognized for his pioneering work on asynchronous programming and modules.

Key Contributions and Impact
Q Promise Library: Kowal is the creator of Q, one of the earliest and most popular JavaScript libraries for implementing promises. Q provided a robust and comprehensive API for managing asynchronous operations, helping to solve the "callback hell" problem. It offered features like Q.defer(), Q.all(), Q.nfcall() (for Node.js callback adaptation), and error handling constructs. The Q library significantly influenced the adoption and understanding of promises in the JavaScript ecosystem.


Promises/A+ Specification: His work with Q was instrumental in shaping the Promises/A+ specification. This specification standardized the behavior of the then method, ensuring interoperability between different promise implementations. Promises/A+ became the foundation for native JavaScript Promises (ECMAScript 2015). Kowal was a key contributor to the discussions and prior art (like his "UncommonJS Thenable Promises specification") that led to Promises/A+.
CommonJS Modules: Kowal also played a significant role in the CommonJS module system, which was popularized by Node.js and NPM. This system defined a standard for how JavaScript modules could be written and used, enabling better code organization and reusability in server-side and other JavaScript environments.
Asynchronous Programming Evangelism: Beyond specific libraries and specifications, Kowal was a vocal advocate and educator for better asynchronous programming patterns in JavaScript. He helped transition the community from callback-dominated patterns to more manageable and composable promise-based approaches.
General Theory of Reactivity: His work extends to broader concepts of reactivity in software, as seen in projects like "gtor" (A General Theory of Reactivity).
ASAP Task Queue: He also developed asap, a high-priority task queue for Node.js and browsers, designed to execute tasks as soon as possible, typically before I/O or rendering events.
In essence, Kris Kowal's work provided foundational tools and specifications that have had a lasting impact on how JavaScript developers write and manage asynchronous code and structure their applications. His Q library and contributions to Promises/A+ were pivotal in the journey towards the native Promise object in JavaScript.
